# RabbitMQ-Example-Service
Create nonsense files and send them in a silly loop, for science.

Configuration of host doesn't work, currently uses "localhost," please fix this in your code or change host manually in files RabbitReadWorker.cs and RabbitPublishWorker.cs

Note: RabbitMQ Server must be set up as well to test this service.
